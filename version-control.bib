   "During software evolution, information about changes between different

    tasks. For example, configuration-management systems can use change
    information to assess possible conflicts among updates from different
    users. For another example, in regression testing, knowledge about which
    parts of a program are unchanged can help in identifying test cases that

Software Engineering},   title={A state-of-the-art survey on software

  This is quite dated, since it was published in 2002.  It's not bad for what it
is, stating a number of concerns like types of merging, conflict detection,
conflict resolution, and delta algorithms.  However, the treatment is
superficial because of limited space and many topics to cover.  There isn't much
synthesis, nor analysis of what works well and what does not, and when.  More
often each technique is described as its paper abstract and conclusion probably
do.
  I wish the paper had settled on one term for each concept.  "syntactic
conflicts" or "textual conflicts" are derived from the text of a file.
"Structural conflicts" or "syntactic conflicts" come from representing the code
as a parse tree.  A "semantic conflict" or "behavioral conflict" requires a
model of program semantics (such as denotational semantics or program dependence
graphs).  "a static semantic conflict" is detected by a compiler.  "Structural
merging" is related to refactoring and restructuring, such as extracting an
interface or adding a new class in the middle of a class hierarchy.
  "change-based merging ... uses information about the precise changes that were
performed during evolution of the software", typically by instrumenting the
software development environment.
  The conclusion states, "Graphs look promising as an underlying
representation".  It also says "we need techniques for merging more than two
parallel versions simultaneously.", because there exist teams of more than 2
people.  But it doesn't justify why repeated 2-way merging is not adequate.

abstract = {An ongoing problem in revision control systems is how to resolve conflicts in a merge of independently developed revisions. Unstructured revision control systems are purely text-based and solve conflicts based on textual similarity. Structured revision control systems are tailored to specific languages and use language-specific knowledge for conflict resolution. We propose semistructured revision control systems that inherit the strengths of both: the generality of unstructured systems and the expressiveness of structured systems. The idea is to provide structural information of the underlying software artifacts --- declaratively, in the form of annotated grammars. This way, a wide variety of languages can be supported and the information provided can assist in the automatic resolution of two classes of conflicts: ordering conflicts and semantic conflicts. The former can be resolved independently of the language and the latter using specific conflict handlers. We have been developing a tool that supports semistructured merge and conducted an empirical study on 24 software projects developed in Java, C#, and Python comprising 180 merge scenarios. We found that semistructured merge reduces the number of conflicts in 60% of the sample merge scenarios by, on average, 34%, compared to unstructured merge. We found also that renaming is challenging in that it can increase the number of conflicts during semistructured merge, and that a combination of unstructured and semistructured merge is a pragmatic way to go.},

abstract = {Even though many programmers rely on 3-way merge tools to integrate changes from different branches, such tools can introduce subtle bugs in the integration process. This paper aims to mitigate this problem by defining a semantic notion of conflict-freedom, which ensures that the merged program does not introduce new unwanted behaviors. We also show how to verify this property using a novel, compositional algorithm that combines lightweight summarization for shared program fragments with precise relational reasoning for the modifications. Towards this goal, our method uses a 4-way differencing algorithm on abstract syntax trees to represent different program versions as edits applied to a shared program with holes. This representation allows our verification algorithm to reason about different edits in isolation and compose them to obtain an overall proof of conflict freedom. We have implemented the proposed technique in a new tool called SafeMerge for Java and evaluate it on 52 real-world merge scenarios obtained from GitHub. The experimental results demonstrate the benefits of our approach over syntactic conflict-freedom and indicate that SafeMerge is both precise and practical.},
