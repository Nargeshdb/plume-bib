   "Navigate code, find bugs, compute metrics, check style rules, and
    enforce coding conventions in Eclipse with SemmleCode. SemmleCode
    is a new free Eclipse plugin that allows you to phrase these tasks
    as queries over the codebase - it thus takes the search facilities
    in Eclipse to a whole new level. A large library of queries for
    common operations is provided, including metrics and Java EE style
    rules. Query results can be displayed as a tree view, a table view,
    in the problem view, as charts or graphs, all with links to the
    source code.",
