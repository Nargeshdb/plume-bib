Directory of BibTeX bibliography files.

This is a set of BibTeX bibliographies, with the following features:
 # Already typed in, so you don't have to do that work.
 # Capitalization is corrected.  Bibliographies downloaded from the web
   often have incorrect capitalization; the ACM Digital Library is one
   notorious offender.
 # Short and long versions of names, locations, and dates for conferences,
   journals, etc.  The short (abbreviated) version is convenient if your
   paper is nearing its page limit.
 # Correct, detailed dates.  Dates contain days of the month, which give
   the dates of just the appropriate track rather than the whole conference.
 # Searchable via the bibfind tool.  For instance, 
     bibfind keyword1 keyword2
   displays all the bibliographies with all the keywords, either in the
   entries in the comments.  (This is why there are no line breaks in the
   comments, though we may lift that restriction in the future.)


USAGE
-----

To choose the abbreviated (short) or unabbreviated (long) version of the
bibliography strings, use one of these commands in your LaTeX file:
  \bibliography{bibstring-abbrev,...}
  \bibliography{bibstring-unabbrev,...}

When using the bibliographies, add near the top of your LaTeX document:
  \usepackage{relsize}
  \usepackage{url}
  \def\UrlFont{\smaller\ttfamily}
These define the \url command used in the bibliographies, and make it use
in a slightly smaller font (the regular tt font is very big).


EDITING AND ADDING ENTRIES
--------------------------

Changes, corrections, and additions are welcome.

When adding new bibliography entries, please use bibliography strings
rather than hard-coding conference/journal/institution names, locations,
and dates.  Add the new abbreviations to bibstring-master.bib as necessary.


SETUP
-----

Obtain the bibliographies by running the command

  hg clone https://plume-bib.googlecode.com/hg/ plume-bib  

Then, add the "plume-bib" directory to your BIBINPUTS environment variable.
bash syntax:
  export BIBINPUTS=.:PATHTOPLUMEBIB:..:
csh syntax:
  setenv BIBINPUTS .:PATHTOPLUMEBIB:..:

For the bibfind command, see http://code.google.com/p/uwisdom/wiki/README
It uses the "bibroot" file in the repository.

Note for miktex users:
The bibtex that is supplied with miktex (the popular Windows implementation)
does not support the BIBINPUTS variable. You need to modify the miktex
configuration.  In file ...\miktex\config\miktex.ini, edit this entry:
 Input Dirs=searchpath 
(search path for BibTeX input files -- both databases and style files).
