   "This paper addresses two interrelated problems currently confronting
    computer science education, motivating students while simultaneously
    providing them with the skills they'll need to solve complex
    interconnected problems. We describe a framework for motivating computer
    science students by adding the context of social good to introductory
    computing assignments. Adding the context in this manner also goes some
    way to addressing the need for graduates to have skills, attributes and
    behaviours appropriate to contributing to social good
    outcomes. Accompanying this, we provide 14 concrete examples of
    introductory computing projects that convey and reinforce computing's
    social relevance and potential for positive societal impact."

   "Like many engineering schools, MIT found itself faced with the challenge of
    providing engineering students with an educational program that develops an
    ever-broader range of technical and nontechnical abilities. With the
    primary curriculum already overloaded, the School took an alternative
    approach. Launched in 2002, the Undergraduate Practice Opportunities
    Program (UPOP) is a new co-curricular program for sophomores that provides
    professional engineering experience and develops students non-technical
    professional abilities. The UPOP program goal is to integrate three
    essential parts of effective learning: knowledge, experience, and
    reflection. UPOP consists of: 1) Knowledge 1- The program begins with an
    intensive week of engineering practice ``boot camp'' during the January
    intersession and is led by engineering and management faculty. Through
    active case-based and role-playing learning sessions, students gain
    practical knowledge and appreciation for interpersonal and presentation
    skills, leadership, professional ethics, organizational dynamics, product
    development, and statistical quality control; 2) Knowledge 2- In Spring,
    students attend alumni-led workshops on career development; 3) Experience-
    In Summer, students complete 12 weeks of employment where they will be able
    to realize UPOP s educational objectives; 4) Reflection 1- During Summer,
    students complete a structured journal that permits exploration of
    engineering teamwork, communication, and organization; 5) Reflection 2- In
    Fall, students meet to discuss their experiences with other students and
    faculty. Assessment and evaluation of the new program included activity
    feedback surveys, student pre- and postactivity ability self-assessment
    surveys completed by UPOP students and a control group, employer survey of
    student performance, and performance scoring of student journals. Analysis
    of data revealed student improvement in many key non-technical professional
    abilities such as teamwork, presentation, identification of customer needs
    as part of the product development process, and comprehension of
    organization dynamics and strategy concepts compared with the control
    group.",
